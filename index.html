                        <p>It is the first song on the EP with the same name, an intro that expresses what it feels like
                            to go enjoy the beach, what it means to detach yourself from any worry that one has, and
                            what it means to meet someone and lose the fear of what that may happen, just follow what
                            you feel. A dancehall inspired by projects like AfroLOVA'23, with characteristic guitars of
                            the genre and synth that simulate marimbas that give a tropical vibe.</p>

                        <p>Music, alcohol, the perfect environment for something to happen, for both to let themselves
                            go, to dance, to steal a kiss. There is no better way to represent it than with a reggeaton,
                            the perfect genre for parties and to disconnect while dancing.</p>

                            happen, it only takes one yes. A combination between deephouse and reggaeton that leaves the
                            tropical environment a little to give way to a more urban vibe.</p>

                        <p>Summer is for doing everything, except crying. The fifth song on the EP is not the happiest,
                            but it tries to say that despite living through bad moments, bad relationships, bad
                            memories, that is not all in life, and we have to enjoy it, with or without someone by our

                            time. As the last song, an afrobeat that follows the line of tropical sounds, generating a
                            nocturnal atmosphere, an atmosphere of farewell, not only to the person in the story, but
